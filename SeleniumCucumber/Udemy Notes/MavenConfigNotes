1. clean: (cmd: mvn clean) this will clean the mvn project and delete everything in target folder 
2. compile: (cmd: mvn compile) this will start a fresh compilation 
3. test: (cmd: mvn test) this will run the tests

Parallel execution using Maven: 
* Tests and runner need to be present in src/test/java 
* Tests will run parallely in different sessions but on same browser type 
* Add the configuration in maven-surefire-plugin in pom.xml 
		1. forkCount - Number of VM to create and run in parallel 
		2. reuseForks - true: use any VM that is up for the test 
						false: create a new VM for every test 
		3. testFailureIgnore - true: continue the execution despote of failure 
								false: stop the execution if a test failed 
		4. includes - to specify the filename (runner file)
