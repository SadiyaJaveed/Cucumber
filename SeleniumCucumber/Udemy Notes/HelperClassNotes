Helper Class:

Singleton design pattern is used in this framework to create helpers 

1. Create private variables		 
2. Create a private Constructor
		Constructor should be private-so that no other class can create object of this class		
3. Create a getInstance() method which will give the object of this class 		
4. Create custom methods to perform actions
